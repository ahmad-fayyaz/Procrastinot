## **New Features**
1. **Task Management Interface:**
   - A dedicated panel to manage tasks directly within Obsidian's workspace.
   - Create, edit, and delete tasks seamlessly.

2. **Dynamic Filters:**
   - Filter tasks by:
     - **Status:** (`not started`, `in progress`, `completed`)
     - **Tags:** Custom tags for task categorization.
     - **Due Date:** Specify tasks due on specific dates.

3. **Countdown Timers:**
   - Live countdown for each task to show time remaining until the due date.
   - Tasks automatically display "Expired" after the due date has passed.

4. **Status Dropdown:**
   - Quickly change the status of a task using a dropdown menu.
   - Status options: `not started`, `in progress`, and `completed`.

5. **Task Grouping:**
   - Non-completed tasks appear prominently at the top.
   - Completed tasks are grouped separately with a divider for easy reference.

6. **Right-Click to Delete Tasks:**
   - Right-click on any task to delete it with a confirmation dialog.

7. **Persistent Storage:**
   - All tasks, statuses, and filters are saved and persist across Obsidian sessions.


## **UI**
- Minimalistic, theme-adaptive styling.
- Color-coded statuses:
  - Red for "not started."
  - Orange for "in progress."
  - Green for "completed" with a satisfying green border for completed tasks.
- Responsive layout for filtering and task creation.


## **Issues**
- Tasks currently default to end-of-day (`23:59`) due times. Time-specific deadlines are not yet supported but are planned for future updates.
- Filters work independently, and combined filter logic could be optimized further in subsequent releases.


## **Coming Soon**
1. **Priority Levels:** Assign `low`, `medium`, or `high` priority to tasks.
2. **Recurring Tasks:** Support for repeating tasks on a daily, weekly, or custom schedule.
3. **Task Notes:** Add detailed descriptions or notes to each task.
